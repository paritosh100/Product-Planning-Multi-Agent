## What's Happening Behind the Scenes?

When you click "Run plan" with CrewAI enabled, three AI agents collaborate:

1. **Project Planner Agent** ‚Üí Creates task breakdown
2. **Effort Estimator Agent** ‚Üí Adds time estimates  
3. **Resource Allocator Agent** ‚Üí Creates milestones and allocations

This sequential workflow ensures comprehensive, realistic project plans.

## Troubleshooting

### CrewAI still showing as "Fallback Mode"?

- [ ] Did you check the "Estimate hours" checkbox?
